        <p>As of 2024 I am a junior at Penn State computer science. As a child, I always enjoyed computer
            related classes. I'd always seek to learn more about computers, how they work, and how to 
            make them perform better. I always liked to repair my various electronic devices and open them to see
            their parts. I also have a passion for video games, which also sparked my interest
            in computer science, as it made me wonder how games were developed.
