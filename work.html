        <h2>My Job History</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Walmart (January 2021 - August 2022)</h3>
                <p>When I was a junior in high school, I obtained my first job at Walmart. Through Walmart, I got my first
                    experience on what it is like to be in the workforce. I learned customer service skills such as operating a cash register,
                    being positive to customers and building rapport, assisting shoppers with finding items in a store, and
                    working on a team to create a positive experience for customers. This job helped get my footing in the 
                    professional world and gave me skills that I still continue with today.

                <h3>Penn State New Kensington (August 2022 - December 2023)</h3>
                <p> Before I started college, I left my job at Walmart to focus on school and wanted to find a campus job
                    that would help with my skills in technology. I was able to get a job as an IT Service Desk Consultant
                    on campus before I started. Through this position, I solved over 80 tickets and over 100 phone calls to help students
                    and faculty members with their technology problems. Some tasks I did involved routinely checking every classroom
                    to make sure that equipment such as the computers, projectors and sound systems were working properly, troubleshooting
                    various devices such as faculty printers that had errors on printing, work laptops that needed help with display settings
                    on external monitors and fixing apps such as Microsoft Office to function properly, phones to be set up with Two-Factor 
                    Authentication to allow students and faculty to use their Penn State accounts, printing posters for various organizations
                    and student research, and taking pictures of students for IDs that I printed. This work experience is valuable to me as it
                    further improved my troubleshooting and customer service skills, and allowed me to learn how to communicate better towards others.
