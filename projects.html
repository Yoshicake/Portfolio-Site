                <h3>Kai'Sa Bot</h3>
                <p>Kai'Sa Bot is a personal project I made in JavaScript. It is a Discord bot themed on Kai'Sa
                     from League of Legends that can do various fun activities. Kai'Sa Bot can play chance-based
                     games with the user, such as rock-paper-scissors as well as flipping a coin. It can also provide player statistics
                     for three video games: League of Legends, Valorant and Fortnite, located on tracker.gg. It can also return the current champion build for League of Legends
                     champions, taken from u.gg, a trusted website for displaying champion builds.
