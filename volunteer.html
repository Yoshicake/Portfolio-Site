                <h3>Esports Club</h3>
                <p>
                    At Esports club, I was elected as treasurer for the 2024-2025 school year. I showed interest in helping the club and the willingness to learn which got me elected.
                    Through this role, I've learned how to manage the finance of the club, spreadsheeting and making sure we have the funds to spend on what we need. I have also 
                    learned various ways of fundraising, such as through sponsors. Our club received a sponsorship from Genshin Impact, a popular adventure game, and for one of our 
                    deliverables, I did a cosplay of Zhongli from the game, which, along with the deliverables the rest of the board did, helped secure $750 in funding for our club.
                    I also learned how to request funding from the university to fund our activities by making pitches on forms I filled out, successfully requesting and getting over $2500
                    in funding approved for the club.

                <h3>Alliance Christian Fellowship</h3>
                <p>
                    Alliance Christian Fellowship, known as ACF, is a church fully run by students on campus. A local church provides a pastor for us but the students run the 
                    activities and functions of the club. I was elected as part of their trustees, where I help with setup and teardown of weekly Sunday services at the HUB, 
                    the most popular spot on campus. I assist in various ways such as setting up our sound and streaming equipment for YouTube and a live audience, attending 
                    monthly meetings for the club, and serving through concession stands during football games, which is the alternative to offering and provides the club with
                    a lot of funding. This allows us to rent our room for Sunday service and do many events such as a semester retreat, providing fun night activities such as 
                    pizza parties and bowling night.
